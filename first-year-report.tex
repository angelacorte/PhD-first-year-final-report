    \section{Context}\label{sec:context}

    Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS) are ensembles of distributed devices, such as sensors,
    actuators,
    and robots,
    that cooperate to achieve global goals under dynamic and unpredictable environmental conditions~\cite{DBLP:conf/huc/Ferscha15}.
    %
    Programming such systems is inherently challenging,
    as it requires addressing issues of scalability, device heterogeneity,
    and the ability to adapt to continuously changing contexts.
    %
    Over the years,
    several approaches have been proposed to alleviate this complexity.
    %
    In particular,
    macroprogramming techniques~\cite{casadei22} aim at raising the level of abstraction,
    allowing developers to express the behavior of the system at a collective level,
    without having to explicitly manage the interactions of each single device.
    %
    A foundational contribution in this direction is the \emph{Field Calculus (FC)}~\cite{JLAMP2019,TOCL2019},
    a formal model for programming collective behaviors through the notion of computational fields,
    which map values over space and time and enable composable definitions of self-organizing processes.

    Building on these ideas,
    \emph{Aggregate Computing (AC)}~\cite{BealIEEEComputer2015} provides a functional programming approach that supports the compositional development of self-adaptive collective services.
    %
    Through AC,
    the focus of computation shifts from individual devices to collaborative groups,
    making it possible to express complex adaptive behaviors in a concise and modular way.
    %
    Despite its expressive power,
    however,
    existing aggregate computing approaches typically assume the presence of a single aggregate program running across the distributed system. This
    %
    assumption is often unrealistic in practical scenarios,
    where multiple processes must coexist,
    overlap,
    and evolve in parallel,
    each one involving a different subset of devices and spanning distinct spatial and temporal regions~\cite{EAAI2020-processes}.
    %
    Such situations call for abstractions and mechanisms that are not yet fully addressed in the current state of the art.

    To meet these challenges,
    this research project proposes the development of a \textbf{Collective Operating System (COS)},
    an execution and management environment for aggregate processes that extends the principles of aggregate computing by borrowing concepts from operating systems.
    %
    Much like a traditional OS manages multiple processes, users,
    and resources on a single centralized machine~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/TanenbaumR85},
    the COS is envisioned as middleware capable of coordinating multiple aggregate programs distributed in space and time across heterogeneous devices.
    %
    The project investigates how classical notions of operating systems --such as users and permissions, signals and interrupts,
    inter-process communication, and resource management --can be reinterpreted and redefined in a collective and distributed setting.

    In this perspective,
    users and permissions must be understood as roles and rights distributed across groups of devices and human actors,
    signals and interrupts must be adapted to collective processes where interventions may affect entire spatial regions rather than single execution threads,
    and communication among processes must be reconceived beyond classical shared-memory or message-passing mechanisms,
    to enable coordination among distributed and possibly non-contiguous regions.
    %
    Furthermore,
    the project addresses the challenge of distributed sensing and actuation,
    where heterogeneous devices can be abstracted into logical collective sensors and actuators,
    thereby enabling high-level sensor fusion~\cite{DBLP:journals/arc/Sasiadek02}.

    The proposed COS will therefore act as a unifying middleware that manages concurrent aggregate processes,
    provides mechanisms for permissions and communication,
    and supports deployment on heterogeneous infrastructures.
    %
    By integrating recent developments in aggregate programming languages and frameworks,
    such as Collektive, the COS aims to offer a robust, adaptive,
    and general-purpose environment for programming Collective Adaptive Systems.
    %
    The expected contribution is a novel paradigm that bridges aggregate computing with distributed operating system principles,
    enabling more powerful, flexible,
    and reliable collective applications in scenarios such as crowd management, autonomous navigation, and smart cities.

    \section{Future Work and Research Plan}\label{sec:future}


%    The initial effort has been devoted to extending the foundations of aggregate computing with explicit support for process management,
%    enabling the creation, execution, and termination of processes with spatial and temporal scope.
%    %
%    This extension has been realized through a formal model based on Field Calculus,
%    which ensures that processes remain localized, composable, and adaptable to dynamic conditions.
%    %
%    Preliminary results obtained through simulation demonstrate the feasibility of running concurrent processes in parallel,
%    even when their execution spans non-contiguous regions,
%    while maintaining localized consistency and resilience.
%    %
%    Early experiments further indicate that role-based access and permissions can be expressed in terms of contextual constraints,
%    allowing subsets of devices to be dynamically allocated to specific processes.
%    %
%    Exploratory prototypes have also been developed to handle signals and interrupts,
%    enabling runtime reconfiguration and adaptation while preserving safety through scope and authorization checks.
%    %
%    These results provide encouraging evidence that classical operating system concepts can be reinterpreted effectively in the collective domain.


%    The next phase of the project will focus on consolidating these initial findings into a coherent model of a Collective Operating System.
%    %
%    A primary research direction will be the design of mechanisms for inter-process communication,
%    enabling distributed processes to exchange information and coordinate across spatially distinct regions.
%    %
%    Another crucial objective will be the integration of heterogeneous devices into collective abstractions for sensing and actuation,
%    thus providing robust interfaces for sensor fusion and distributed control.
%    %
%    The research plan involves refining the theoretical model of aggregate processes,
%    implementing the proposed abstractions in the Collektive framework,
%    and conducting extensive simulation campaigns to assess performance,
%    scalability, and resilience under diverse conditions.
%    %
%    Finally, the system will be validated through application scenarios such as smart city coordination,
%    large-scale monitoring, and autonomous navigation,
%    demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed middleware in managing multiple processes in dynamic, heterogeneous environments.
%    %
%    The overall goal is to establish a principled foundation for the Collective Operating System,
%    bridging aggregate computing and distributed operating system principles while providing concrete benefits for real-world Collective Adaptive Systems.

        \item \emph{A Field-based Approach for Runtime Replanning in Swarm Robotics Missions}~\cite{DBLP:conf/acsos/AguzziBCMPPV25}
        \textbf{Abstract:}
        Ensuring mission success for multi-robot systems operating
        in unpredictable environments requires robust mechanisms to react to unpredictable events,
            such as robot failures,
            by adapting plans in real-time.
            %
            Adaptive mechanisms are especially needed for large teams deployed in areas with unreliable network infrastructure,
            for which centralized control is impractical and where network segmentation is frequent.
            %
            This paper advances the state of the art by proposing a field-based runtime task replanning approach grounded in aggregate programming.
            %
            Through this paradigm,
            the mission and the environment are represented by continuously evolving fields,
            enabling robots to make decentralized decisions
            and collectively adapt the ongoing plan.
            %
            We compare our approach with a simple late-stage replanning strategy
            and an oracle-centralized continuous replanner.
            %
            We provide experimental evidence that
            the proposed approach achieves performance close to the oracle if the communication range is sufficient,
            while significantly outperforming the baseline even under sparse communication.
            %
            Additionally, we show that the approach can scale well with the number of robots.

        \item \emph{A Demonstrator for Self-organizing Robot Teams}~\cite{DBLP:conf/coordination/AguzziBBCCDFPV25}
        \textbf{Abstract:}
            Aggregate computing is a paradigm with over a decade of investigation and multiple programming frameworks available,
            which proved to be particularly suitable for the simulation of applications in challenging domains such as smart cities and robot swarms.
            %
            This paper introduces a toolchain for practical multi-robot demonstrations based on aggregate computing principles,
            and validates it with a live interactive demo in an open-public event in the context of the European Researchers’ Night.
            %
            More specifically,
            we show how we coordinated a team of mobile robots to form spatial patterns.
            %
            We discuss the practical demonstration performed in an indoor environment,
            which exploits a camera system and ArUco markers for localization.

        \item \emph{FieldVMC: An Asynchronous Model and Platform for Self-organising Morphogenesis of Artificial Structures} --
        \textbf{Abstract:}
        The VMC is an approach
        to structure development
        inspired by the way plants branch and distribute nutrients.
%
        It has proven useful
        to guide shape formation in modular robotics
        as well as
        resource distribution in hierarchically structured organizations, such as large companies.
%
        In this work,
        we propose FieldVMC: a generalization of VMC,
        founded on the field-based approach known as  aggregate computing,
        which is applicable to arbitrary topologies
        (i.e., undirected graphs rather than trees)
        and supports asynchronous and decentralized execution.
%
%Along this line,
        We redesign VMC as a field-based computation,
        hence enabling the emergence of organizational hierarchies %in a decentralised and asynchronous way,
        out of self-organizing interactions among local entities.
%
        The benefits of our approach are manifold.
%
        Being decentralized and free from topological constraints,
        our approach makes VMC applicable to arbitrary networks;
        being based on a well-known computational model,
        inheriting scalability, asynchronicity, and self-organizing capabilities;
        being implemented in a functional field-based computation framework,
        fostering reuse and composability.
%
        To support our claims, we conduct in-silico quantitative experiments comparing FieldVMC with the original VMC.
        The results demonstrate that FieldVMC is a monotonic extension of VMC, offering
